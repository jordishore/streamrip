And while many fans will head straight for the pair of full-set live shows that make up the bulk of this edition's tracklisting, one would be ill-advised to sleep on the version of the actual album that's included here. Yes, it's yet another remaster, but in this case the work has been done by Bob Weston, who not only brings decades of experience recording, mixing, and mastering your favorite indie rock bands (everyone from Sebadoh and Polvo to Chavez and Archers of Loaf), but he was also Albini's assistant engineer during the <em>In Utero </em>sessions. Even more notably for this remaster, Weston was able to work with the original analog master tapes, resulting in an exceptional presentation of an album that has always seemed too brawny and bristly to fit into any standard musical delivery device. Weston brings a full-bodied warmth to the material that does nothing to tamp down the splenetic intensity of this intentionally abrasive album, but somehow gives it even more emotional impact. Similarly, Seattle studio legend Jack Endino (who produced <em>Bleach</em>) was brought on to mix and master the live material from soundboard tapes. While Weston was able to harness the crackling warmth of the album tracks, Endino goes straight for maximum impact on the live material, giving the two shows\u2014one in L.A. at the beginning of the <em>In Utero</em> tour, and the other in Seattle for the band's final show in that city\u2014an absolutely explosive presence. The well-rounded mix of the live material gives the performances plenty of dynamics and a surprising amount of clarity, whether it's the plinky-plonky intro of \"Milk It\" in Seattle giving way to bass-heavy riffing or the clanging garage groove of \"About a Girl\" in Los Angeles. While it's a fool's errand to deem a release such as this as a \"definitive\" one, the combination of Weston's remarkable remaster with two incredible-sounding concerts from the era (plus all the released b-sides from the album) makes a strong case for this edition being exactly that ... at least until the next big anniversary. \u00a9 Jason Ferguson/Qobuz</p>", "description_language": "en", "goodies": [], "area": null, "catchline": "", "composer": {"id": 573076, "name": "Various Composers", "slug": "various-composers", "albums_count": 583621, "picture": null, "image": null}, "created_at": 0, "genres_list": ["Pop/Rock", "Pop/Rock\u2192Rock"], "period": null, "copyright": "\u00a9 2023 UMG Recordings, Inc. \u2117 2023 UMG Recordings, Inc.", "is_official": true, "maximum_technical_specifications": "", "product_sales_factors_monthly": 0, "product_sales_factors_weekly": 0, "product_sales_factors_yearly": 0, "product_type": "album", "product_url": "/fr-fr/album/in-utero-nirvana/y6x0dqvaswhfc", "recording_information": "", "relative_url": "/album/in-utero-nirvana/y6x0dqvaswhfc", "release_tags": ["deluxe"], "release_type": "album", "slug": "in-utero-nirvana", "subtitle": "Nirvana"}, "work": null, "composer": {"id": 129081, "name": "Kurt Cobain"}, "isrc": "USGF19960702", "title": "Scentless Apprentice", "version": "2023 Remaster", "duration": 227, "parental_warning": false, "track_number": 2, "maximum_channel_count": 2, "id": 223973848, "media_number": 1, "maximum_sampling_rate": 44.1, "articles": [], "release_date_original": null, "release_date_download": null, "release_date_stream": null, "release_date_purchase": null, "purchasable": true, "streamable": true, "previewable": true, "sampleable": true, "downloadable": true, "displayable": true, "purchasable_at": 1698390000, "streamable_at": 1698390000, "hires": false, "hires_streamable": false}
